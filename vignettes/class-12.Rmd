## 1. Speeding up Rmd knitting

Read the [Guide to RMarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) for an exhaustive description of the various formats and options for using RMarkdown documents.

### Caching

You can speed up knitting of your Rmds by using caching to store the results from each chunk. Note that if you modify the code chunk, previous caching is ignored.
  
For each chunk, set `{r, cache = TRUE}`

Or the option can be set globally at top of the document.

```r
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

### Or, save and load Rds/Rda files instead of rerunning resource intensive parts

## 2. Finding useful packages

In most cases, what you need is already made into well-documented packages, and you don't have to reinvent the wheel (but sometimes you should?). Depending on where the package is curated, installation is different. Some examples below:

1. `Gviz` - visualize gene model
2. `VennDiagram` - making custom venn diagrams
3. `emo` - inserting emojis into Rmd

```{r packages, eval = FALSE}
# BiocManager::install("Gviz") # from bioconductor
vignette("Gviz")

# install.packages("eulerr") # from CRAN
plot(eulerr::euler(list(set1 = c("geneA", "geneB", "geneC"), 
                       set2 = c("geneC", "geneD"))))

# devtools::install_github("hadley/emo") # from github
emo::ji("smile")
```

## 3. Git - version control

Advantages of using version control include: 

1. rolling back code if needed

2. branched development

3. collaboration, etc

[Getting started](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control)

[Interactive practice](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)

```{bash git, eval = FALSE}
ls
git blame assignments.Rmd
```

This can be handled by rstudio as well (new tab next to `Build`)

### Put your code on GitHub

As you write more code chunks and functions, hosting and documenting them on GitHub is great way to make them portable and searchable. Even the free tier of GitHub accounts now has private repos.

If you have any interest in a career in data science/informatics, GitHub is also a common showcase of what (and how well/often) you can code. After some accumulation of code, definitely put your GitHub link on your CV.

### Example repo - [valr](https://github.com/rnabioco/valr)

Refer to package examples and [guide to building packages](https://r-pkgs.org/index.html) to build your own package and website documentation.

### Asking for help with other packages on GitHub

Every package should include README, installation instructions, and `issues` page where questions and bugs can be reported. Example: [readr GitHub page](https://github.com/tidyverse/readr/issues) Don't be afraid to file new issues, but very often your problems are already answered in the `closed` section.

## 4. Other tips/best practices

### a. Code and data organization

Read this paper: [A Quick Guide to Organizing Computational Biology Projects](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000424)

```{bash folders, eval = FALSE}
NEWS.md   # markdown document for tracking progress
data      # data directory for storing raw and processed data
dbases    # database files downloaded from other places
docs      # publication documents and random project files
your-project.Rproj # Make an Rproject in Rstudio for every project
results   # store all RMarkdown here
src       # store useful scripts here
```

### a2. `here`, folder structure management

https://github.com/jennybc/here_here

```{r here, eval = FALSE}
here::here() # always points to top-level of current project

here::here("vignettes", "class-12.Rmd") # never confused about structure
```

### b. `styler`, clean up code readability

Refer to this [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) often, so you don't have to go back to make the code readable/publishable later.

```{r styler, eval = FALSE}
styler::style_text("
my_fun <- function(x, 
y, 
z) {
  x+
    z
}
                   ")

#> my_fun <- function(x,
#>                    y,
#>                    z) {
#>   x +
#>     z
#> }

# styler::style_file
# styler::style_dir
```

### c. Benchmarking, with `microbenchmark` and `profvis`

```{r bench, eval = FALSE}
path_to_file <- system.file("extdata", "gene_tibble.csv", package = "pbda")
res <- microbenchmark::microbenchmark(
  base = read.csv(path_to_file),
  readr = readr::read_csv(path_to_file),
  times = 5
)
print(res, signif = 2)
microbenchmark:::autoplot.microbenchmark(res)

library(dplyr)
p <- profvis::profvis({
  path_to_file <- system.file("extdata", "gene_tibble.csv", package = "pbda")
  c1 <- readr::read_csv(path_to_file)
  c1 <- c1 %>%
    filter(padj < 0.00001) %>%
    mutate(gene = stringr::str_to_lower(gene))
})
p
```


### d. `shiny`, interactive web app for data exploration

Making an interactive interface to data and plotting is easy in R. Examples and corresponding code can be found at https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/.

### e. Running R script from terminal

Save functions in .R files to easily `source()` them later. If you have code that does not need input from beginning to end, .R files can be executed from the command line/terminal as well.

```{bash script, eval = FALSE}
Rscript /Users/rf/teach/practical-data-analysis/R/mat.R
```

## 5. Finding help online

![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_of_the_ancients.png)

 The [R studio community forums](https://community.rstudio.com/) are a great resource for asking quesitons about tidyverse related packages.  
 
 [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) provides user contributes questions and answers on a variety of topics. 
 
 For help with bioconductor packages visit the [support page](https://support.bioconductor.org/) 
 
 Find out if others are having similar issues by searching the issue on the [Github](https://github.com/) page for the package that you are using. 
 
### General R coding resources

  Hadley Wickman has written very good (free) ebooks on using R. 
  
  [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
  
  [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/)
  
### Bioinformatic resources

  For general bioinformatics advice I found the following text very useful.  
  
  [Bioinformatics Data Skills](http://vincebuffalo.org/book/) by Vince Buffalo

  For statistics related to bioinformatics this free course is excellent:  
  
  [PH525x series - Biomedical Data Science](http://genomicsclass.github.io/book/)
  
  For more detailed descriptions of single cell RNA-Seq analysis:  
  
  https://scrnaseq-course.cog.sanger.ac.uk/website/index.html
  
  https://satijalab.org/seurat/vignettes.html
  
### Cheatsheets

Common ones can be found in Rstudio `Help` -> `Cheatsheets`. More are hosted online, such as for [regular expressions](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/RegExCheatsheet.pdf).

Useful to keep your own stash too.
  
## 6. Offline help

We (the RBI fellows) hold standing office hours on Thursdays, walk-ins 1-2pm, by appointment 2-4pm, in RC1-South Room 9101. We are happy to help out with coding and RNA/DNA-related informatics questions. Send us an email to let us know you will be stopping by (`rbi.fellows@cuanschutz.edu`).

## 7. Lastly, sometimes code is just broken

No one writes perfect code. A certain highly-regarded and cited scRNA-seq package drew cell type progression arrows in the wrong direction, for months before the issue was fixed!

Go to GitHub and search the issues to see if the problem has been reported or fixed. If not submit an issue that describes the problem. The [reprex package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) makes it easy to
produce well-formatted R reproducible examples that demonstrate the problem. Often developers will be thankful for your help with making their software better.

## 8. Use R often. Don't (try not to) use Excel.
